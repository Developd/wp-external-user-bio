# wp-external-user-bio

When installed on two sites, creates a link between a user's bio on each site.

The origin site is determined by the local user's website profile setting.

The origin site must have the plugin installed and active to complete the link.

Shortcode (local site): `[user_bio_external user_id=1]`
